Hi, my name is Giuseppe Russo, but you can call me Peppe.
 I am a 3rd year PhD student at ETH Zurich [Frank Schweitzer](https://www.sg.ethz.ch/team/frank_schweitzer). 
 My research revolves around improving moderation policies to reduce harm caused by fringe communities on social platforms.
 Currently, I'm at at the  [School of Computer and Communication Sciences](https://www.epfl.ch/education/phd/edic-computer-and-communication-sciences) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch), where I am advised by [Robert West](https://dlab.epfl.ch/people/west).
  My focus is on using natural language processing and causal inference techniques to identify causal relationships between harmful online behavior on social platforms. Through the analysis of large-scale text data from social media and other sources, I hope to provide actionable insights to improve online safety and well-being for everyone.

Outside of work, I love traveling back to my lovely hometown of [Bagheria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bagheria) in Sicily. If you're in Lausanne, Zurich, or Sicily and want to talk about research, feel free to drop me an email!
